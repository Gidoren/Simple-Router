A SIMPLE ROUTER


This project was designed to create a  topology with a local network of hosts, and one rogue host that must
have a specific set of packets to be dropped, in order to keep it from being malicious

FILES I HAVE INCLUDED:

final_skel.py
This file is the topology of the hosts and switches set by the mini net for the project

finalcontroller_skel.py
this is the redirection and routing algorithm used to keep the malicious host from manipulating the server
while also giving direct locations for switches to send packets towards based on the destination ip
